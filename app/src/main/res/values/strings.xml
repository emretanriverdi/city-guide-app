    <string name="info_main_text">Batumi is a popular tourist destination known for its varying weather. It\'s a bustling seaside resort during warm seasons, but also it can get entirely covered in snow during winter.\nMuch of Batumi\'s economy revolves around tourism and gambling, but the city is also an important sea port and includes industries like shipbuilding, food processing and light manufacturing. Since 2010, Batumi has been transformed by the construction of modern high-rise buildings, as well as the restoration of classical 19th-century edifices lining its historic Old Town.</string>
